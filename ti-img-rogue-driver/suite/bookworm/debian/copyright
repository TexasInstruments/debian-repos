 The routines implemented here are built on top of an abstraction layer to
 hide DDK/OS-specific details in case they are used outside of the DDK
 (e.g. when trusted device is enabled).
 Any new dependency should be added to rgxlayer.h.
 Any new code should be built on top of the existing abstraction layer,
 which should be extended when necessary.

 DESIGN NOTE
 This transport layer consumer-role API was created as a shared API when a
 client wanted to read the data of a TL stream from within the KM server
 driver. This was in addition to the existing clients supported externally
 by the UM client library component via PVR API layer.
 This shared API is thus used by the PVR TL API in the client library and
 by clients internal to the server driver module. It depends on
 client entry points of the TL and DEVMEM bridge modules. These entry points
 encapsulate from the TL shared API whether a direct bridge or an indirect
 (ioctl) bridge is used.
 One reason for needing this layer centres around the fact that some of the
 API functions make multiple bridge calls and the logic that glues these
 together is common regardless of client location. Further this layer has
 allowed the defensive coding that checks parameters to move into the PVR
 API layer where untrusted clients enter giving a more efficient KM code path.

 @Description
 Implements generic resource allocation. The resource allocator was originally
 intended to manage address spaces. In practice the resource allocator is
 generic and can manage arbitrary sets of integers.
 .
 Resources are allocated from arenas. Arenas can be created with an initial
 span of resources. Further resources spans can be added to arenas. A
 callback mechanism allows an arena to request further resource spans on
 demand.
 .
 Each arena maintains an ordered list of resource segments each described by a
 boundary tag. Each boundary tag describes a segment of resources which are
 either 'free', available for allocation, or 'busy' currently allocated.
 Adjacent 'free' segments are always coalesced to avoid fragmentation.
 .
 For allocation, all 'free' segments are kept on lists of 'free' segments in
